# Great job for keeping up so far, the rewards far outweight the labour 💪

## PROJECT FIVE: Introduction to Responsive Design (Grid);
We'd be adding another powerful responsive technique to our skillset called Grid.

We'd attempt to design our HealthCare website again, using a combination of flex box, media queries, relative units and css grid.

Blending these responsive techniques are very powerful in making fully responsive designs as we would come to see.

Other techniques like hiding elements on the page using `display: none` and `position: fixed` would also be utilized in putting this project together.

Having touched what are arguably the most fundamental things to know about responsive designs, we would begin to incoporate javascript and all its loveliness to our succeeding projects.


- You're really doing great so far 👍.

**Happy Coding🚀 and Remember, Jesus loves you!!**
